(2x+3)^3 = C(3,0)(2x)^3 + C(3,1)(2x)^2(3) + C(3,2)(2x)(3)^2 + C(3,3)(3)^3. x^2 term: C(3,1)*4x^2*3 = 3*4*3*x^2 = 36x^2. Coefficient is 36. But 36 is an option. Let me check: (2x+3)^3 = 8x^3+36x^2+54x+27. Hmm wait: C(3,1)*(2x)^2*3 = 3*4x^2*3 = 36x^2. Yes, coefficient is 36. But 54 is listed as answer. Let me recheck: expanding (2x+3)^3 = (2x+3)(2x+3)(2x+3). (2x+3)^2 = 4x^2+12x+9. (4x^2+12x+9)(2x+3) = 8x^3+12x^2+24x^2+36x+18x+27 = 8x^3+36x^2+54x+27. So x^2 coefficient is 36. The answer is 36.
