Hmm, not unique from this alone. Let me use more constraints. Row 2 starts with 3 and has col 2 needing from {1,3,4}: could be 1 or 4. Testing: if row 2 col 2 = 4, then row 2 = [3,4,?,?] needs 1,2. Row 3 col 2 gets {1,3} remaining. Additional constraints may narrow... This puzzle needs more deduction. Let me verify: If (2,2)=4: Row 2 [3,4,1,2]. Row 3 starts 4, col 2 remains {1,3}.
