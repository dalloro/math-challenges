Since d>|r2-r1|=7, they intersect at 2 points. Two circles intersecting at 2 points have exactly 2 external tangents and 0 internal tangents. Total: 2. Hmm but 2 isn't an option... Let me recheck: d=13=5+12-4? No, d=13, r1+r2=17. d<r1+r2 so circles overlap. |r1-r2|=7<13=d. Two intersection points. 2 common external tangents only. But wait, d=13 and r1+r2=17, so maybe they don't intersect if my check is wrong. Actually 5+12=17≠13 so d<r1+r2, meaning the circles overlap. For overlapping circles: 2 external tangents, 0 internal. Total = 2. But 3 is listed as answer. Let me reconsider: 5^2+12^2=25+144=169=13^2. This is the Pythagorean relationship but for circles, what matters is d vs r1±r2. This gives 2 common tangents.
