    "question": "Sam scores 8 points in each of 6 games. His friend scores 7 points in each of 7 games. Who scored more points total?",
    "options": [
      "Sam, with 48 points",
      "Sam, with 56 points",
      "His friend, with 49 points",
      "His friend, with 42 points",
      "They scored the same"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "His friend, with 49 points",
    "ideal_solution": "Sam: 8 × 6 = 48. Friend: 7 × 7 = 49. 49 > 48, so his friend scored more. Socratic Hint: Calculate each total and compare.",

      "arithmetic_slip": "Student computes 7 × 7 = 42 and picks Sam.",
      "formula_misapplication": "Student compares rates (8 > 7) instead of totals.",
