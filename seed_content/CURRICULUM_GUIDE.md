# Curriculum Guide — Grade-Anchored Math Questions
## Based on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for Mathematics

> **Core principle:** Difficulty levels 1–10 modulate complexity *within* a grade's curriculum scope. A Level 10 question for Grade 1 must still be solvable by a very bright first-grader, not a college student.
>
> **Source:** Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (corestandards.org), supplemented by Beast Academy (Grades 1-5), MATHCOUNTS (Grades 6-8), and AMC/AIME (Grades 9-12) for stretch-level calibration.

## How Difficulty Levels Work

| Level | Label | What It Means (relative to the grade) |
|-------|-------|---------------------------------------|
| 1–2 | Warm-up | Straightforward single-concept application. One step. |
| 3–4 | On-grade | Requires careful reading or a small twist. 1–2 steps. |
| 5–6 | Challenge | Multi-step or multi-concept. Beast Academy / Math Kangaroo level for that age. |
| 7–8 | Competition | Creative thinking, working backwards, combining ideas. Hard for the grade. |
| 9–10 | Stretch | Hardest a gifted student at this grade could solve. May touch concepts from **1 grade ahead only**. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A "Level 10, Grade 1" question should be hard **for a 6–7 year old**. It should never require knowledge from Grade 3+.
