# Product Guidelines - Math Challenges

## Tone and Voice
- **Academic Rigor meets Modern Engagement:** The application should communicate with the authority of a formal gifted assessment while maintaining the excitement of a modern learning platform.
- **Supportive but Challenging:** Use precise, professional terminology for math concepts, but pair it with achievement-oriented language that celebrates effort and mastery.

## Visual Identity
- **Clean & Focused Aesthetic:** A minimalist, distraction-free interface designed to maximize concentration during 100+ question sessions.
- **Distinctive Branding:** Incorporate the official "Math Challenges" logo consistently in headers and as a webapp icon to establish professional credibility.
- **High Readability:** Prioritize professional typography and generous whitespace. Use a neutral palette with intentional accent colors for key interactions.
- **Adaptive Visualization:** Include a "Progressive Challenge Bar" that visually communicates the current difficulty or "Rank," providing a gamified sense of leveling up as questions become more complex.

## AI Interaction & Feedback
- **Socratic Feedback Loop:** In the Open Reasoning modality, both AI feedback and pre-recorded ideal solutions must prioritize hint-first pedagogy. Direct answers and full derivations are hidden behind toggles or presented only after initial inquiry.
- **Metacognitive Focus:** Feedback should prioritize *how* a student thinks over simply *what* the final answer is.

## Learning Intervention (Thematic Shift)
- **Visual Cognitive Reset:** When the Learning Model triggers (after two failures), the interface should undergo a subtle thematic shift—such as a background color change to a "focus" blue—to clearly signal the transition from assessment to instruction.
- **Instructional Clarity:** Walkthroughs should be presented in a structured, step-by-step format to reduce cognitive load during remediation.
